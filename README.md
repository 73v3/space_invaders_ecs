# Space Invaders ECS
A Space Invaders game built with Bevy 0.16 and ECS in Rust.

WARNING: This is my very first Rust project. I know NOTHING! Do not mistake the atrocities within for best practice.

At the time of writing, I have been learning Rust and Bevy for a grand total of 7 days.

I am also old and don't understand github properly. This is meant to be a fork of:

https://github.com/Biped-Potato/bevy_space_invaders/tree/master

But I never actually forked. I just used it as a starter and then expanded on it and rearranged a bunch of stuff.

I share this an educational exercise as it will hopefully end up covering a lot of basic ground common to creating a 2d game in Bevy.
