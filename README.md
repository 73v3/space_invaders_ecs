WARNING: This is my first Rust project, created after 7 days of learning Rust and Bevy. The code is not a model of best practices but serves as a learning resource for others interested in Bevy and ECS.

This project was inspired by [Biped-Potatoâ€™s Bevy Space Invaders](https://github.com/Biped-Potato/bevy_space_invaders), used as a starting point and significantly expanded.

## Code Orientation

Copy [collated_src.txt](assets/collated_src.txt) into your favourite AI and discuss the code with it. For example, Grok identified the following weaknesses in the ECS design:

## Weaknesses

Overall I'm not entirely happy with the project organisation. I've come from years of object-orientation, and moving to ECS, I'm still not sure where everything belongs.

>> Collision Handling:

Brute-force nested queries in update_collisions are simple but inefficient.

Detection is proximity based rather than via bounding boxes, which has its accuracy limitations.

Detection could potentially be centralised to its own collisions plugin.

>> Event and State Management:

Events are underused.

Game speed increments are scattered (e.g., on alien kill, shift down, wave clear). A centralized speed-adjust system reading events would consolidate this.
